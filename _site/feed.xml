In order to assess whether a differential profile of monocytes may be involved in the generation of these genital MoDCs, we have herein characterized the blood monocyte compartment of Beninese HESNs (HIV-uninfected ≥ 10 years CSWs) and relevant controls (HIV-uninfected 2.5–5 years CSWs herein termed “early HESNs”), HIV-infected CSWs, and low-risk HIV-uninfected women from the general population. Transcriptomic analyses by RNA-Seq of total sorted blood monocytes demonstrate that in comparison to the control groups, HESNs present increased expression levels of FCGR2C, FCAR, ITGAX, ITGAM, CR2, CD68, and CD163 genes, associated with effector functions. Moreover, we found increased expression levels of genes associated with protection/control against SHIV/HIV such as CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, BHLHE40, and TNFSF13, as well as with immune regulation such as IL-10, Ahr, CD83, and the orphan nuclear receptor (NR)4A1, NR4A2, and NR4A3. Through multicolor flow cytometry analyses, we noticed that the frequencies of intermediate and non-classical monocyte populations tended to be elevated in the blood of HESNs, and exhibited increased expression levels of effector CD16, CD11c, CD11b, as well as regulatory HLA-G, IL-10, and IFN-α markers when compared to HIV-uninfected women and/or HIV-infected CSWs. This profile is compatible with that previously reported in the FGT of HESNs, and likely confers an enormous advantage in their resistance to HIV infection.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">WestGrid Summer School 2020</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/badges/2020/07/20/westgrid-summer-school.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="WestGrid Summer School 2020" /><published>2020-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/badges/2020/07/20/westgrid-summer-school</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/badges/2020/07/20/westgrid-summer-school.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="badges" /><category term="CCDB" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A First Insight into North American Plant Pathogenic Fungi Armillaria sinapina Transcriptome</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/genomics/2020/07/04/armillaria-sinapina.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A First Insight into North American Plant Pathogenic Fungi Armillaria sinapina Transcriptome" /><published>2020-07-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/genomics/2020/07/04/armillaria-sinapina</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/genomics/2020/07/04/armillaria-sinapina.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="genomics" /><category term="transcriptomics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Armillaria sinapina, a fungal pathogen of primary timber species of North American forests, causes white root rot disease that ultimately kills the trees. A more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this illness will support future developments on disease resistance and management, as well as in the decomposition of cellulosic material for further use. In this study, RNA-Seq technology was used to compare the transcriptome profiles of A. sinapina fungal culture grown in yeast malt broth medium supplemented or not with betulin, a natural compound of the terpenoid group found in abundance in white birch bark. This was done to identify enzyme transcripts involved in the metabolism (redox reaction) of betulin into betulinic acid, a potent anticancer drug. De novo assembly and characterization of A. sinapina transcriptome was performed using Illumina technology. A total of 170,592,464 reads were generated, then 273,561 transcripts were characterized. Approximately, 53% of transcripts could be identified using public databases with several metabolic pathways represented. A total of 11 transcripts involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were identified. In addition, 25 gene transcripts that could play a significant role in lignin degradation were uncovered, as well as several redox enzymes of the cytochromes P450 family. To our knowledge, this research is the first transcriptomic study carried out on A. sinapina.]]></summary></entry></feed>
