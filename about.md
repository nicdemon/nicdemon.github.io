I come from a biological and environmental sciences background with both a technical and a bachelor's degrees in this domain.
I have then specialized in bioinformatics by studiyng at the DESS level in bioinformatics and sfterwards in computer sciences with the Master's degree in machine learning application to a biological context.
Being in-between biology and computer sciences makes me able to understand both worlds and connect them for optimal collaboration and solution design.
