description: Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) is a medicinal fungus used in traditional medicine of Native American and North Eurasian cultures. Several studies have demonstrated the medicinal properties of chaga’s bioactive molecules. For example, several terpenoids (e.g., betulin, betulinic acid and inotodiol) isolated from I. obliquus cells have proven effectiveness in treating different types of tumor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms and regulation underlying the biosynthesis of chaga terpenoids remain unknown. In this study, we report on the optimization of growing conditions for cultured I. obliquus in presence of different betulin sources (e.g., betulin or white birch bark). It was found that better results were obtained for a liquid culture pH 6.2 at 28 °C. In addition, a de novo assembly and characterization of I. obliquus transcriptome in these growth conditions using Illumina technology was performed. A total of 219,288,500 clean reads were generated, allowing for the identification of 20,072 transcripts of I. obliquus including transcripts involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. The differential expression of these genes was confirmed by quantitative-PCR. This study provides new insights on the molecular mechanisms and regulation of I. obliquus terpenoid production. It also contributes useful molecular resources for gene prediction or the development of biotechnologies for the alternative production of terpenoids.
