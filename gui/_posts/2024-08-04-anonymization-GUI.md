description: A more advanced version of the <em>McGill barn video uploads app</em>. This desktop app form preprocesses the video data on-site (a barn) before uploading video files to the WELL-E file storage server. On-site preprocessing consists of multiple operations such as anonymization of barn staff, video trimming, video encryption, etc. to reduce the size of files transferred and to keep security at a maximum. This app uses <a href="https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer/endpoints_and_collections/" target="_blank">Globus endpoints</a> to transfer data efficiently as well as private packages to run preprocessing operations locally.
