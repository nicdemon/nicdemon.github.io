description: The project consisted of building an interactive interface for biologists to explore Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP) per patient in the context of long COVID.<br>The interface allowed biologists to explore the data in three panels.<ol><li>Query molecules and visualize either expression per patient of the expression distribution in the whole population or selected individuals group</li><li>Vizualise and explore heatmaps for which antigen groups and patients populations were defined to be of interest by Dr Poudrier</li><li>Build custom heatmaps by selecting antigens and patients from both lists</li></ol>All graphs were interactive to give a maximum of flexibility to the users.
contributors: Johanne Poudrier (Main user and Biological expert)
tasks: Create original exploration graphs, Design & develop RShiny application, Ensure availability of application for users, Design & add features upon user request
tools: R, plotly, ggplot2, RShiny, R tidyverse
