Also, few methods for metagenomic sequencing reads were based on machine learning (ML) methods. Moreover, previous projects in the Diallo laboratory were led to leverage ML methods to classify viral sequencing reads without alignment procedures.\n\nBuilding on this, the present research project aimed to design and develop a method for classifying bacterial sequencing reads by leveraging ML methods without alignment procedures, and try to valorise a maximum number of reads produced from the original sample. This project was led for my master‚Äôs thesis.","type":"content","url":"/posts/projects/metagenomics/caribou#id-project-objective","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master‚Äôs thesis research project","lvl3":"üìã Project description","lvl2":"Design of a machine learning approach for bacterial microorganisms detection in metagenomic sequencing without alignment procedures"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/posts/projects/metagenomics/caribou#id-project-description","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Master‚Äôs thesis research project","lvl3":"üìã Project description","lvl2":"Design of a machine learning approach for bacterial microorganisms detection in metagenomic sequencing without alignment procedures"},"content":"To achieve the goal, a pipeline made of four modules was designed.\n\nData preparation and ingestion\n\nBacterial reads extraction\n\nBacterial reads classification\n\nResults output for biological analysis\n\nFor both ML steps, multiple models using different methods were used.

A collection of projects I have worked on troughout the years. \n\n Data Sciences  ::::{tab-item} Data Sciences\n::::  Metagenomics \n\nInformation\n\nMetagenomics projects aim to caracterize the content of a microbial community found in a given environment. These communities can be found in multiple environments such as human gut, soil, plant root system, oceanic water, etc. Often, these communities are caracterized by determining the bacterial species present in one or more sample as well as their abundance. Multiple DNA sequencing technologies can be used to extract DNA present in a sample and computational methods for caracterizing the communities are often specialized to the sequencing technology of DNA extraction method used (16S rRNA or Whole Genome Shotgun).\n\nMaster's thesis research project\n\nDesign of a machine learning approach for bacterial microorganisms detection in metagenomic sequencing without alignment procedures\n\nDate: January 14, 2024\n\nDESS Metagenomic analysis\n\nMetagenome data analysis remake from a reference article\n\nDate: March 27, 2020 Transcriptomics \n\nInformation\n\nTranscriptomics aim to analyse the expression of genes in a given sample taken from one or more individuals. These analysis can be run on RNA or DNA depending on the research interest and the sequencing technology used. For each sequencing types, certain methods exist for processing and analyzing data.\n\nDESS Internship\n\nBiewer Terrier dog breed WGS analysis pipeline development\n\nDate: August 01, 2023\n\nMonocytes RNA-Seq analysis\n\nMonocyte Gene and Molecular Expression Profiles Suggest Distinct Effector and Regulatory Functions in Beninese HIV Highly Exposed Seronegative Female Commercial Sex Workers\n\nDate: February 10, 2022\n\nArmillaria sinapina article\n\nA First Insight into North American Plant Pathogenic Fungi Armillaria sinapina Transcriptome\n\nDate: July 04, 2020\n\nInonotus Obliquus article\n\nRNA-Seq de Novo Assembly and Differential Transcriptome Analysis of Chaga (*Inonotus obliquus*) Cultured with Different Betulin Sources and the Regulation of Genes Involved in Terpenoid Biosynthesis\n\nDate: September 04, 2019 Apps \n\nInformation\n\nAvailable demos have been remade with synthetic data to respect property rights\n\nNote\n\nSome Web apps cannot be accessed as they require to be authenticated within the organization they were made for, therefore no link is provided for these apps\n\nTeam process analysis webapp\n\nPowerApp for team process analysis\n\nDate: July 14, 2025\n\nBarn preprocessing & upload\n\nA preprocessing and uploading app for barn data in an edge computing setting\n\nDate: August 04, 2024\n\nMcGill barn video uploads\n\nA desktop interface for uploading videos from the barn\n\nDate: June 05, 2024\n\nLLaMARJO webapp\n\nLivestock labeling Learning for Manual Analysis & Recognition as a Journal of Observations webapp\n\nDate: May 06, 2024\n\nREAP data visualization\n\nRShiny app for data visualization of REAP results\n\nDate: February 18, 2018 Websites \n\nDigital portfolio v2\n\nRevamping of my portfolio website\n\nDate: October 10, 2025\n\nDigital portfolio v1\n\nOriginal implementation of my portfolio website\n\nDate: October 31, 2024\n\nDESS PhyML project\n\nPhyML dynamic website implementation\n\nDate: May 05, 2020","type":"content","url":"/projects","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Training"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/training","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Training"},"content":"Intro to SQL\n\n\n\nDate: July 23, 2025\n\nFeature Engineering\n\n\n\nDate: June 15, 2025\n\nData Visualization\n\n\n\nDate: May 13, 2025\n\nIntermediate Machine Learning\n\n\n\nDate: April 02, 2025\n\nIntro to Machine Learning\n\n\n\nDate: April 01, 2025\n\nPrepare Data for Looker Dashboards and Reports\n\n\n\nDate: January 13, 2025\n\nAnalyze and Visualize Looker Data\n\n\n\nDate: November 06, 2024\n\nGoogle Cloud Computing Foundations Certificate\n\n\n\nDate: May 31, 2024\n\nPrepare Data for ML APIs on Google Cloud Skill Badge\n\n\n\nDate: May 31, 2024\n\nBuild a Secure Google Cloud Network Skill Badge\n\n\n\nDate: May 24, 2024\n\nSet Up an App Dev Environment on Google Cloud Skill Badge\n\n\n\nDate: May 10, 2024\n\nImplement Load Balancing on Compute Engine Skill Badge\n\n\n\nDate: April 30, 2024\n\nCreate a model-driven application in Power Apps\n\n\n\nDate: June 02, 2025\n\nCreate and manage model-driven apps with Power Apps and Dataverse\n\n\n\nDate: June 02, 2025\n\nDevelop dynamic reports with Microsoft Power BI\n\n\n\nDate: January 06, 2025\n\nMicrosoft Power BI Data Analyst\n\n\n\nDate: January 06, 2025\n\nManage workspaces and datasets in Power BI\n\n\n\nDate: January 06, 2025\n\nDesign effective reports in Power BI\n\n\n\nDate: December 10, 2024\n\nBuild Power BI visuals and reports\n\n\n\nDate: December 10, 2024\n\nModel data with Power BI\n\n\n\nDate: November 27, 2024\n\nGet started with Microsoft data analytics\n\n\n\nDate: November 25, 2024\n\nGet and transform data with Power BI\n\n\n\nDate: November 20, 2024\n\nPrepare data for analysis with Power BI\n\n\n\nDate: November 20, 2024\n\nMicrosoft Azure Fundamentals - Describe Azure management and governance\n\n\n\nDate: March 16, 2024\n\nMicrosoft Azure Fundamentals - Describe Azure architecture and services\n\n\n\nDate: March 16, 2024\n\nMicrosoft Azure Fundamentals - Describe cloud concepts\n\n\n\nDate: March 06, 2024 ::::{tab-item} AWS\n:::{trainingsList}\n:category: AWS\n:::\n::::  ::::{tab-item} Coursera\n:::{trainingsList}\n:category: Coursera\n:::\n:::: \n\nProject Management with MS Project\n\n\n\nDate: April 30, 2025\n\nWestGrid Summer School 2020\n\n\n\nDate: July 20, 2020\n\nFirst steps on compute servers\n\n\n\nDate: May 27, 2020","type":"content","url":"/training","position":1}]}
