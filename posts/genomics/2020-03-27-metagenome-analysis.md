# DESS Metagenomic analysis

## Metagenome data analysis remake from a reference article

:::{margin}
### Team:
* Abdellatif El Ghizi
:::

This is a session project for two classes at UQAM. An article was chosen to fetch data from and was then analyzed using an alternate pipeline to familiarize with CLI genomic analysis tools and recreate results obtained in the base article.
1. Analyse the microbiota using the Mothur analysis pipeline and tools on data found in the article for the course BIF-7104
2. Make a taxonomic relations tree using the identified species in a subjects microbiota which would be use for further biological analysis for the course BIF-7101

### Contribution:
* Retrieve the raw sequencing data
* Quality control of the data
* Curate the data according to QC
* Run the Mothur analysis pipeline on the data
* Run the MetaWrap analysis pipeline on the data
* Use HPC an server from the Digital Research Alliance of Canada for the analysis
* Assemble genomes present in the sequencing data
* Plot the results of the analysis
