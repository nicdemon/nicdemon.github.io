LLMARJO is a software that enables user-centric learning in the processes of behavior annotation.

This software is based on knowledge acquired manually in past experiments to provide automations in the process of video creation for training, practicing and certification as well as management of the users training.

*LLaMARJO was created to ease the training process of behavior encoding in videos and remove pressure from the domain experts in the WELL-E team by automating certain tasks.*
