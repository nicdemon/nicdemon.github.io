A simple desktop app form for uploading whole folders to the WELL-E file storage server. Under the hood, it leverages the `rsync` linux command from a Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) instance to upload data over SSH. Using a desktop GUI eases the upload of data by biologists gathering data in the barn.
