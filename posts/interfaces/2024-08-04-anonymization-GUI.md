A more advanced version of the [McGill barn video uploads app](/posts/interfaces/2024-06-05-rsync-GUI.md).

This desktop app form preprocesses the video data on-site (a barn) before uploading video files to the WELL-E file storage server. On-site preprocessing consists of multiple operations such as anonymization of barn staff, video trimming, video encryption, etc. to reduce the size of files transferred and to keep security at a maximum.

This app uses [Globus endpoint](https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer/endpoints_and_collections/) to transfer data efficiently as well as private packages to run preprocessing operations locally.
