# Digital portfolio v2

## Revamping of my portfolio website

The present website hosted on Github Pages.

The second version was made with the MyST Markdown framework and was inspired by [Chris Holdgraf's blog](https://chrisholdgraf.com/).

I remade this website so it would be more dynamic and could handle interactive documents.
