### Team:
* Golrokh Kiani
* Pr Abdoulaye Baniré Diallo
:::

### 🎯 Project objective
Internship project at the end of the DESS in bioinformatics.
* Develop and document a DNA-seq gene variants identification pipeline

### 📋 Project description
In collaboration with a Veterinarian research laboratory for the CERMO-FC, aimed to identify genetic variants causing birth malformations causing prematured death in Biewer Terrier dog breed.

The data available were DNA-seq sequencing of prematurely dead individuals and their parents to compare gene expression and identify variants.

### 🎨 Implementation decisions
* Study variant calling pîpelines
* Develop Bash scripts for running variant calling pipeline steps on HPC cluster.
* Computing resources from the [Canadian Numerical Research Alliance](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical_documentation) were used.
* Explore automation tools for tying together the pipeline steps

### 🧾 Key takeaway
* Variant calling DNA-seq experience
* Bash scripting skills development
* HPC clusters experience with tasks parallelization and optimisation of resources
