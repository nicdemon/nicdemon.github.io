# Digital portfolio v2

## Revamping of my portfolio website

### 🎯 Project objective
Revamp my personnal portfolio website.

### 📋 Project description
The present website hosted on Github Pages.

The second version was made with the MyST Markdown framework and was inspired by [Chris Holdgraf's blog](https://chrisholdgraf.com/).

I remade this website so it would be more aestetic, dynamic and could handle interactive documents.

### 🎨 Design & implementation decisions
* Publish on Github Pages
* Leverage the Myst Markdown framework

### 🧾 Key takeaway
* Second iteration of my portfolio website
* Custom blogging capabilities to create semi-dynamic content at build time
